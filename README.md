# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This study guide was made to store what we learned in the course prework all in one place to review. Building this webpage allowed me to not only learn but apply what I just learned to create a webpage using HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.


## Installation
N/A

## Usage
There are notes associated within each section detailing what I have learned. We can use the ChromeDevTools to decide what we should study first. Open the DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MACOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). This would open a console panel and it would list the sections covered and recommend a topic to study first.
